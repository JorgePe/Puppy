# Puppy
Small Android Application for LEGO Powered Up made with MIT App Inventor

Why "Puppy"?
Powered Up is being called PUP. It reminds me of Scooby-doo nephew catchphrase ("Puppy Power!").

NOTE:

When building the final APK there is a [bug with the BLE Extension](https://www.hackster.io/daquilnp/bluetooth-hr-monitor-android-app-with-mit-app-inventor-27229c) permissions. After installing it, you need to give permissions to access Location.
